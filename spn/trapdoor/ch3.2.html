    <u>TEASER</u>
  </p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">EXT. CRAIGHEAD FOREST PARK. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">PHONE CAMERA: INSTAGRAM LIVE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">BOBBIE PATRICK, 26, a young Black woman with short, natural hair and a sun-faded baseball cap smiles into the camera. She's filming herself on an Instagram Live feed, standing in a sunny forest. Bobbie wears a windbreaker over a bright teal fleece.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">A RADIO plays music distantly in the background.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Hey guys! We're still here in Craighead Forest Park, in Jonesboro... We're expecting a little rain in the next few days, and then, after that, we'll pack up and head out. But honestly, it's been so nice, I wouldn't mind staying another week or two...</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">The way she speaks is natural, not over-cheerful or affected like a YouTuber. It feels like we're watching a video message from a friend. As she speaks into the camera, reactions pop up in the sidebar, mostly positive: smileys, hearts, cheerleader comments.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">...So we'll see. Mitch says he's up for whatever.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(louder)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Right, Mitch?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She pans, landing on MITCH ANDERSON, 26, a young Latino man with hair slightly longer than usual for a guy. He's sitting in a lawn chair, next to an old VW van with the awning out. The music is coming from the radio next to him--<a href="https://youtu.be/zUr5_QVPCAI">“DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE”</a> by The Mamas &amp; The Papas.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Mitch looks up from his paperback.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">MITCH</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Yup. That's right.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(to camera)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">That's right. It's the weekend now, so the campers are here too...</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">As she speaks, we can see Mitch answer a call on his phone in the background.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">MITCH</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(distant)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Hello?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Bobbie swivels the camera--away from Mitch--to show other RVs parked close by in the trees.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">The people next to us have a <u>really</u> cute little preschooler. He took me salamander hunting this afternoon. Why don't more guys ask me if I want to go salamander hunting? The answer is obviously ‘yes.’</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Bobbie breaks off, distracted by something off-camera. She raises her eyebrows, listening, then nods briefly.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">All right--duty calls. We'll catch you guys later.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">One last smile, then the feed goes black.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">END PHONE CAMERA POV.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Bobbie locks her phone and looks up expectantly at Mitch. He's standing now, hanging up his own phone.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Go time?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">MITCH</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Yup. That was Holden.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Oh, no.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">MITCH</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Oh, yes. They found the next one.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(with aplomb)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">All right. Pack it up. Let's roll.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">SONG transitions to soundtrack:</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">
    <em>Love can never be exactly like we want it to be...</em>

  <p class="screenplay screendir">Bobbie marches to the VW van while Mitch takes down the clothesline. Bobbie POPS the awning down, and then climbs into the cab, driver's side, SLAMMING the door shut.</p>

    <u>ACT ONE</u>
  </p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">EXT. JONESBORO POLICE DEPARTMENT. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">A familiar RUMBLE. The Impala (viewed from behind) pulls up outside the Jonesboro Police Department and parks between two patrol cars. DEAN is in the driver's seat with a phone to his ear. He's alone.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">He kills the engine.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(to phone)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">...Yeah. Sounds like it.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean climbs out, phone still to his ear. He's wearing his FBI suit. He rests his elbow on the roof of the car as he listens.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Behind the police station, fall is changing a couple of trees from green to yellow. The police station is an ugly concrete building, with an American flag waving out front and an over crowded parking lot.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">That's what Jody said. It takes the victims' eyes. Five so far.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay transition">CUT TO:</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">In the Bunker's library, SAM sits in front of his laptop, talking on his phone.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">SAM</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Yeah, eyes and sometimes other organs... Local cops got any suspects yet?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN (O.S.)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(on phone)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">No, nothing. I talked to the detective on the phone, and he seemed like kind of a pushover...</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay transition">BACK TO:</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">EXT. JONESBORO POLICE DEPT. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(derisive)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">...He said he didn't know why I was bothering to come down, but that he'd be "glad to have the extra help."</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay transition">BACK TO:</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">SAM</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Hm. Weird thing to say to the FBI.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN (O.S.)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(on phone) (sarcastic)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Kinda. I don't know why I'm coming down either, Detective, maybe the five dead bodies?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">SAM</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Yeah. Well, I'll get to digging. I know I've heard of something like this before. Mom said she might pitch in too. I'll ask Cas.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">EXT. JONESBORO POLICE DEPT. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean looks at his shoes, then the horizon.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">...Sounds good.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">We turn along with Dean. Two rows away, parked among the patrol cars and SUVs, sits a VW van--cream with teal detailing.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean notices it, and squints at it--it's out of place. We recognize it as the influencers' van from the teaser.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">SAM (O.S.)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(on phone)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Dean? You there?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Yeah. How's Jack doing?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">SAM</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">He's a little better. Mostly asleep, but he wakes up for meals, so...</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN (O.S.)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(on phone)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">That's good.</p>

  <p class="screenplay character">SAM (O.S.)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(on phone)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Yeah. I'll call you when we come up with anything. Good luck with the weird detective.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Thanks.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">He hangs up.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay transition">TRANSITION TO:</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. JONESBORO POLICE DEPARTMENT. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean enters the police station alone, flashing his badge to the front desk secretary. She points him back into the bullpen, and he nods thanks.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. JONESBORO POLICE DEPARTMENT - BULLPEN. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">DETECTIVE LAWRENCE HOLDEN (30s) is just getting up from his desk.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Detective Lawrence Holden?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">That's me. Can I help you?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean flashes his fake badge.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Special Agent Stills. We spoke on the phone yesterday?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Oh, it's you. Good to meet ya.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">They shake hands.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Well, I hate to throw you right into the thick of it, Agent Stills, but another body turned up this morning.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Another one of the--?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">With his index and pinkie fingers, Dean pulls down his lower eyelids, rolling his eyes so they bulge out--like a zombie.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Det. Holden looks alarmed by this display.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Uh... Yes, it was another... one of the... those.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(disoriented)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Your colleagues have already starting the autopsy.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean's turn for confusion--</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">My colleagues?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">The field agents. From the Bureau.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(uh-oh)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Oh.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I assume they're the ones who called you in? They've been down here helping us for the last few weeks, since the second body turned up.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Oh, they--did. Yes. Well, not them. Their supervisor. I assume. I haven't met--we don't know each other. I'm from the--Headquarters. In D.C..</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Oh. Bringing out the big guns, huh?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">That's right.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(after awkward pause)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">So, you want to see the body?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Lead the way, Detective.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">As Holden turns away, Dean makes a "yikes" face to himself.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay transition">CUT TO:</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. JONESBORO POLICE DEPARTMENT - MORGUE. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">SNAP, flash--a camera takes a picture.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">It's a corpse, mid-autopsy, Y-incised and laid out on the slab. The photographer moves around the table for another shot. Meanwhile, the man doing the autopsy--gloved, goggled, and masked, with headlamp on, selects a tool from the tray.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">CLICK, the door opens--Dean and Holden enter. Behind Holden, Dean squares his shoulders and sets his expression, settling into the G-man performance.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Hi, agents. Your guy from D.C. is here.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(to Dean)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">You said you haven't met--?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(when Dean nods)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">This is Agent Patrick, and Agent Anderson.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">We finally swing around to see the photographer head-on: It's Bobbie, from the teaser. She wears a neat pantsuit and latex gloves, and carries an SLR camera around her neck.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Beside her, the autopsy-ist removes his goggles--it's Mitch. He has an elastic hairband on to keep his longish hair back.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Howdy.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Hi... You are?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Special Agent Stills. Like he said--I'm from D.C..</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Mitch and Bobbie exchange a sidelong look.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">We weren't notified you would be... joining us, Agent Stills.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Well here I am. Bureau sent me down to help. They figured you need the extra help, I guess. Seeing as...</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">He gestures, encompassing the situation at large.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Mitch and Bobbie exchange another look. Bobbie puts on a firm, defensive politeness:</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Well, I'll have to clear it with our A.D. in Little Rock. He didn't notify us about anyone coming down from Headquarters.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Mitch says nothing, but looks at Dean suspiciously.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Of course. And you'll find everything is in order.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I'll get your ID number and contact details after this--?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(nodding stoutly)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Sure thing.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Det. Holden, watching the proceedings, CLEARS HIS THROAT.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Well... Good. Now that we've got that taken care of, what have we got here? Can you bring Agent Stills up to speed?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Bobbie shifts back into business mode. She explains:</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Adam Baldwin, 55, of Baldwin Chiropractic on Maple Street. Found in his office this morning. The M.O. is the same as the other victims. Killed, cause of death unknown, eyes missing.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Anything else missing?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">No. As I'm sure you know from your briefing--?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(Dean nods)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">--the killer sometimes takes other organs from the victims. We've had a missing liver and a missing...</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(to Mitch)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">What was it?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">MITCH</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(looking down into corpse)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Kidney. The last victim was missing a kidney. But this one is intact.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(looking up)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Except that he's dead.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(nodding exaggeratedly)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">...Right.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean looks at Det. Holden.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Is there any connection between the victims?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Nothing so far.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Different social classes, four men and one woman... All adults over 25. All white so far, but given the racial demographics of this city, that's not a surprise.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Any witnesses for Mr. Baldwin here?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">His receptionist found him in his office this morning. I'm about to head over there--I can show you the way, Agent?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Thank you, that'd be great.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">SHHLOP. Dean, Bobbie, and Holden look over.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Mitch is weighing an organ on the hanging scale. They stare at him.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">He looks over, noticing the silence.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">MITCH</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Sorry.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(to Holden)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I'll come too.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She looks at Dean.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DET. HOLDEN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Of course. If you're all set with the autopsy?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Yeah. Mitch can take it from here.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">CLUNK. Mitch weighs another organ--the heart.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay transition">CUT TO:</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. JONESBORO POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean exits the morgue, following Det. Holden. SOMEONE OFFSCREEN calls to Holden, who veers off.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Bobbie appears, and intercepts Dean, startling him.</p>

  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Hey.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(recovering quickly)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">--Hey.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">"Don't ask about my ID number" is written all over his face. Instead, she goes for intimidation:</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Listen. I know you're just following orders by coming down here. But my partner and I have been on this case since day one. We may be young--by Bureau standards--but that doesn't mean we need a <u>babysitter</u>. And we don't appreciate being <u>assigned</u> one. I <u>will</u> be discussing this with my A.D.. </p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Leaving Dean no time for a retort, she turns around and disappears after Holden. Dean watches her go, alarmed.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">EXT. STREET. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">The Impala (seen from the side) is parked on a residential street. Inside, Dean is hunched, talking on the phone. He is also looking down at something--scrutinizing it closely.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">It's his fake FBI badge.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(to phone)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Yeah, and she asked for my ID number. I don't have a goddamn ID number.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">SAM (O.S.)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(on phone)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Just keep evading. You said they're young, right? Just pull rank. Meantime, I'll do some research, see what I can find out about them.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I don't know, Sam. I don't know if I can keep up the charade for--</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Holden walks by, and Dean jumps, HANGING UP. He puts the badge away and gets out, following Holden down the block.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">EXT. BALDWIN CHIROPRACTIC. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean, Bobbie, and Det. Holden stand on a suburban street, across from a yellow Victorian-style two-story house with a sign out front: Baldwin Chiropractic. Crime scene tape and police cars ring the scene.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">On their side of the street is a forest. Holden holds a clipboard and goes over the facts for Dean and Bobbie:</p>

  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Our victim, Mr. Baldwin, was found by his secretary early this morning. She's also the last person to see him alive, as far as we know--she talked to him last night before she went home. Time of death is likely yesterday evening, between 5 and 8 PM.</p>

  <p class="screenplay screendir">She and Holden turn to walk up to the house. Dean watches them go, looking uneasy.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">He glances at the forest. Something catches his eye--he does a double-take, walks over to some blackberry brambles.</p>

  <p class="screenplay dialogue">You need an evidence bag? Or some gloves?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She looks at him expectantly.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Right... Yeah.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">He pats his pockets.</p>

  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Be my guest.</p>

  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I'm gonna follow this trail here, see where they went to.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Okay. I'll tell Holden.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean heads into the woods. She watches him go, eyes narrowed.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">EXT. WOODS. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">A light drizzle has started falling from the gray sky overhead. In the woods, more leaves are changing. Dean walks slowly, eyes on the ground, following a trail we can't see.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">He comes to a small brook, and steps over gingerly. He winces when his right foot touches down on the other side, and continues on. His limp is noticeable--he favors his left, stepping oddly on his right.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Eventually the trail intersects with a walking path. After letting a dog and its owner pass, Dean comes out on the main path. He stands, looking up and down the trail.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Which way did they go?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">He looks up at the treetops, as if for a clue. Nothing. Beat. Sound of WIND IN THE TREES.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean SIGHS QUIETLY. He pulls his phone out of his pocket, and unlocks it. We can't see the screen. He looks at it for a moment, then pockets it again.</p>

  <p class="screenplay character">SECRETARY SUSIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Well, I had to leave early for an appointment. So I signed in his last patient, and then left. She came every two weeks, same time.</p>

  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Another patient?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">...No. Another woman. I could see her through the frosted glass. And it sounded... It sounded like they were having sex.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(surprised)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Oh. Was that--typical for him?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">No. Not at all. It was bizarre. Adam's a professional. I'd never heard of him doing something like that, at work. I didn't... know what to make of it. I was upset, I left, and walked back here. We had an argument, last week, and I thought, I don't know... I didn't know what to think. Maybe it wasn't him at all-- maybe it was someone else in his office. I couldn't really see inside.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She covers her eyes.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I know you said you didn't get a good look at the woman, but what did you see?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">She... had reddish brown hair. A bob. About my length.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean nods, and belatedly notes it down in his notepad.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I know it might sound like it was <u>revenge</u> or something. Because of our argument. But Adam wouldn't do that to me. He wasn't that kind of person.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">And what was your argument about? Last week?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Me leaving my husband. Same old.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean nods, still writing.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>

  <p class="screenplay dialogue">How did you two meet?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>

  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Adam and I met in high school. We weren't really friends, back then. I hadn't seen him for... years, until our 25-year reunion. We hit it off. I don't know. Sometimes, you meet the right person at the wrong time. And then sometimes you meet the wrong person, at the right time.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Which one was he?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Mrs. Toolan shakes her head.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">He was both. Adam was a very nice man. And he was good to me. He wanted good things for me, for us. But I... I couldn't. I couldn't leave my husband, I couldn't go public. My children would never speak to me again. The neighborhood would talk about me, our friends would reject me, I--</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She shakes her head again, holding back tears.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I thought... I kept trying to make myself break things off with him. To end it.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(voice breaking)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">But he was so... He was so <u>happy</u> when we were together. You think my husband is that happy to see me when he gets home from work?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She lets out a SOB, and shakes her head.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">No.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She starts to CRY in earnest, hiding her eyes in the crumpled up tissue. Dean looks tensely around for something to do-- finally he spots a roll of paper towels on the island. He TEARS one off and reaches across to hold it out to her.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She doesn't notice, and continues crying.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean, reluctantly, gets off the stool and circles around the island to hand it to her.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Mrs. Toolan jumps a little when he touches her arm, then takes the paper towel, sniffing.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>

  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">There's going to be a memorial tomorrow. I know it's not about me, but I'm just--dreading it. I have to-- I have to go there tomorrow and pretend he was just a high school friend... My friends, my family, no one ever knew about us. And now they never can.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She looks up at Dean.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">You won't tell them, at the memorial? Or when you talk to his family? You don't have to put all this in your report, right?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Does it matter?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">What do you mean? Of course it matters.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I mean... He's gone.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BECCA TOOLAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">But <u>I'm</u> still here. I still have to live with all these--people, the way they look at me. This is confidential, isn't it?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I... I'll tell my colleagues what you saw. You'll have to help us identify her, if you can. But--his family, no one else has to know.</p>

  <p>The bar was a hipster-type place, not Dean’s usual scene. Bobbie had picked it and given him directions from the precinct. The bar was paneled with unfinished wood and poorly lit by exposed lightbulbs, and populated exclusively by people under 30. Dean felt like an interloper, like it was obvious just from looking at him that he didn’t belong here—but as he walked back in, nobody gave him a second glance. He had his suit and tie on, and really, he looked like just any other middle manager coming home from a day at the office, if you didn’t notice the limp.</p>
  
  <p>Bobbie was alone at the high-top—Mitch had disappeared. She had two bottles of beer in front of her, and was taking a picture with her phone. She angled the bottle so the label could be seen—craft beers with some fancy graphic design.</p>
  
  <p>Dean took the other seat. Eyes still on her phone, she slid a bottle across to him. “Sorry, just a sec—business,” she said, typing fast. “That one’s for you.”</p>
  
  <p>“Thanks,” said Dean. “I’m actually tryin’ to cut back.”</p>
  
  <p>She nodded in acknowledgement. Dean flagged down the waitress and ordered a Shirley Temple.</p>
  
  <p>“Okay,” said Bobbie a moment later, setting her phone aside, facedown. “The people want to know what brand of cute craft beer Mitch and I are drinking tonight. And even if they don’t... now they do.”</p>
  
  <p>“Except I'm the one who's supposed to drink the second beer, because Mitch isn’t actually here.”</p>
  
  <p>“No.”</p>
  
  <p>“Where’d he go?”</p>
  
  <p>“He went back to the precinct, to take samples and send them out for testing,” she explained, taking a drink. “To test for the gorgon poison.”</p>
  
  <p>“But as far as your followers know, he’s having a drink.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yep.”</p>
  
  <p>“So it’s all a smokescreen,” Dean said.</p>
  
  <p>Bobbie smiled crookedly. “That’s showbiz, baby. Ask any influencer.” She took a sip of her beer. “Or, anyone on Instagram, really.”</p>
  
  <p>Dean chuckled. The song on the stereo changed—Dean recognized it. He cocked his head. “An oldie. Don’t expect that in a place like this.”</p>
  
  <p>Bobbie listened too. “Oh, I love this song.”</p>
  
  <p>“<em>You</em> know this song?”</p>
  
  <p>“‘Make Your Own Kind of Music’? Of course I know this song, I love the Mamas and the Papas,” she said.</p>
  
  <p>Dean raised his eyebrows, impressed. “I don’t doubt you, I’m just surprised. Someone your age...”</p>
  
  <p>“Uh-huh,” Bobbie said, her smile unimpressed. “Spotify, man. Also, <em>LOST</em>? It’s the song from the hatch.”</p>
  
  <p>He moved his arms as the waitress set down his drink. “Mitch was a med school dropout, that right?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah,” said Bobbie. “He left around the time I hit the road. Decided to come with me. I think it was a hard decision. He was almost done.” She was still fiddling with her phone on the table.</p>
  
  <p>“How long have you guys been hunting together?”</p>
  
  <p>“A little more than a year,” she said. She sighed. “Honestly, I’m glad you’re here. I think Mitch is still a little offended, but the truth is, we do need the help. We’ve been here almost two weeks now, with nothing to show for it. Nothing except a couple more bodies.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah,” said Dean, “But that’s not your fault.”</p>
  
  <p>“No,” she said, “Not my <em>fault. </em>But I still feel responsible for the fact we haven’t stopped it.”</p>
  
  <p>Dean nodded, studiously removing the cherry, straw, and drink parasol from his Shirley Temple, one by one. “I get that.”</p>
  
  <p>“If we had... Dr. Baldwin would still be fixing people’s backs on Maple Street.” She sighed. “Mitch says I shouldn’t let it get to me.”</p>
  
  <p>“Mitch is right,” said Dean. “You do your best. And that’s the most you can do. Right?”</p>
  
  <p>“That’s a pretty positive spin on a pretty gory situation,” Bobbie said, almost challenging. “Maybe you’re the one who should be writing peppy Instagram posts.”</p>
  
  <p>Dean snorted. “I don’t think I’d be any good at that.” He popped his maraschino cherry into his mouth. “So. You’re a hunter, pretending to be an FBI agent, while you’re also an Instagrammer, pretending not to be an FBI agent pretending to be a hunter. It’s an innovative business model, I’ll give you that.”</p>
  
  <p>It was Bobbie’s turn to snort. “Thank you,” she said wryly. She clicked her ring against her beer bottle. “Yeah. I got loans to pay off, and the influencer thing just kind of happened.”</p>
  
  <p>“Plus silver bullets ain’t cheap.”</p>
  
  <p>She dipped her head. “Exactly.” She shrugged. “So I make up a story for the cameras, about myself, about our life... Oh, we drive around the country, we camp in all the national parks, we watch the sunset. And yeah, it’s a true story. It’s just not the <em>whole</em> story. I leave out one big piece.” Bobbie took a sip of beer. “Like any other influencer. Follow any of them, you’ll see.” </p>
  
  <p>“I’m not on Instagram,” Dean said.</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah. I can tell,” she said. “Well, the only difference between me and them is <em>they</em> believe their own story.”</p>
  
  <p>“But not you.”</p>
  
  <p>“No,” she said. “We get sponsorships, we put gas in the tank; the people get the content they crave, the other people get saved from the things that go bump in the night. Everybody wins.”</p>
  
  <p>“Except Mitch,” said Dean. “Who gets stuck with tox-screen duty.”</p>
  
  <p>Bobbie took another sip of beer, smiling. “He doesn’t mind,” she said. “Promise.”</p>

    <u>ACT FIVE</u>
  </p>
  
  <p>“You’re a siren.”</p>
  
  <p>Fake Bobbie turned to face him where he sat, tied to the chair, and flashed a smile. “Well spotted, tough guy.”</p>
  
  <p>Dean spat out some more blood. She’d ordered Mitch to tie him up, and Dean had tried to wrestle him off—but the kid had two inches of height and 15 spry young years on him, and Dean’s injured foot had unbalanced him. Mitch had overpowered him and tied him up. While Mitch took care of him, the siren had knocked the real Bobbie out herself.</p>
  
  <p>Dean was pretty sure his nose was broken. It wouldn’t stop bleeding, and with every breath, more blood got into his throat. “So,” he said, hoarsely, looking back up at Siren Bobbie. “You made yourself look like Adam’s girlfriend to get into his office.”</p>
  
  <p>“...and tell him everything he wanted to hear.” She put on an affected voice: “<em>Yes</em>, Adam, I’ll leave my husband. <em>Yes</em>, Adam, I'll come live with you. Yes, Adam, I love you and <em>only</em> you.”</p>
  
  <p>Dean’s heart was pounding, sending the blood pulsing out of his nose in waves. He tested the ropes tying him—pretty tight. He still had his knife on his belt, but it was clipped at a weird angle, far from his hands.</p>
  
  <p>What he really needed was to get to his bag, which had fallen near the door. It had a bronze dagger in it. <em>A bronze dagger, dipped in the blood of a victim</em>. If the siren found it before he could get to it, then they were screwed.</p>
  
  <p>He needed to keep her talking until Bobbie woke up.</p>
  
  <p>“And Jeff before that? How long you been running the OKCupid scam? It’s clever, I’ll—” Dean coughed through his nosebleed. “I’ll—give you that,” he managed, rallying.</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you,” said the siren, smiling the same way Bobbie had in the bar the night before. It was uncanny. Dean had seen a siren, and he’d seen shapeshifters take the form of those he knew; he wasn’t sure he’d be able to tell this wasn’t Bobbie. Maybe the siren had studied her social media page. She had her expressions, right down to the smile in her big brown eyes.</p>
  
  <p>“When these two rolled into town, I thought, ‘Ooh, this’ll be a fun challenge.’ But it wasn’t even hard,” she said, derisive. “I took one look through those Instagram photos, and I could see what an easy target he’d make. It’s written all over his face.”</p>
  
  <p>Mitch was hovering near the foot of the bed, silent and blank-eyed, hair in his face. He didn’t look love-struck anymore—he looked like he was getting his mugshot taken.</p>
  
  <p>Dean looked back at the siren.</p>
  
  <p>“Then <em>you</em> rolled in,” she said. “I checked you guys out at the bar last night. <em>Three</em> hunters. Scary! See, now I wasn't so cocky, 'cause you, you were tougher. Once I got a read on you, I almost pulled up stakes and left town.”</p>
  
  <p>“Why?” Dean said through gritted teeth, struggling more obviously against the ropes to distract her from how he was twisting his hip to reach his knife. “'Cause you were afraid you might fall in love with me?”</p>
  
  <p>Then the siren laughed, and it wasn’t like Bobbie’s laugh at all.</p>
  
  <p>“No, Dean,” she said. She wandered closer to him, with the ease of one in control. “Because I could tell right away that my charms wouldn’t work on you,” she said. </p>
  
  <p>Behind her, Dean saw something move on the floor.</p>
  
  <p>Bobbie’s hand.</p>
  
  <p>She was waking up.</p>
  
  <p>Dean looked quickly up at the siren. She was considering him, a hand on her cheek, a pitying look in her eyes, like he was a stray dog in a cage at the pound.</p>
  
  <p>“You know why?” she said.</p>
  
  <p>“Enlighten me,” Dean said through gritted teeth. Behind her, Bobbie curled her arm towards herself on the floor.</p>
  
  <p>She bent closer. “Take Mitch over there. I transformed into his dream girl, and I offered him everything he wanted... and he <em>still</em> couldn’t do it. Couldn’t make himself take it. Pathetic. <em>You</em> suffer from the same affliction, only worse. Maybe because you’re older, and you’ve lived like this for longer than little Mitch here—I don't know. But I could’ve transformed into your wildest fantasy, and you would have stabbed me right in the heart.”</p>
  
  <p>Dean held her gaze fiercely, willing himself not to cough. Willing her not to look around.</p>
  
  <p>Inches away, she murmured: “You think that what you want is wrong <em>because </em>you want it."</p>
  
  <p>The siren patted his cheek. She straightened up.</p>
  
  <p>“So, I decided not to waste my time on you,” she said. She turned to start pacing away.</p>
  
  <p>“Wait—” Dean said, but his breath caught, and he started coughing on his blood again. Too late—she saw.</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, Bobbie, baby,” said the siren, seeing Bobbie silently crouched over the duffel bag. “I don’t think so.”</p>
  
  <p>“The bronze dagger, Bobbie!” Dean yelled.</p>
  
  <p>Bobbie scrambled through the bag, tools and weapons jangling together as she searched. But before the siren could reach her, the door to the motel room banged open again, hitting the wall. Holden.</p>
  
  <p>Gun drawn, the detective’s eyes swept over the scene, taking in Dean, tied up, Mitch, dazed, and “Bobbie,” staring at him with a hungry glint in her eye. Then he spotted the real Bobbie, on one knee next to the door. He swiveled his gun at her, then back to the first, confusion turning to horror in his eyes.</p>
  
  <p>“Who—Bobbie?”</p>
  
  <p>“Holden, that’s not me!” Bobbie said.</p>
  
  <p>“Kill the detective,” the siren said, twitching her finger at Mitch.</p>
  
  <p>Holden fired. The gunshot was deafening in the small space. And it did nothing but put a hole in the siren’s shirt. She looked down at it, over where Bobbie’s heart would be, then back up at the detective.</p>
  
  <p>He stared at her, eyes wide. “What?”</p>
  
  <p>“Mitch,” she said more loudly. “Kill him!”</p>
  
  <p>Bobbie found the bronze dagger.</p>
  
  <p>“Holden, look <em>out!</em>” Dean yelled.</p>
  
  <p>A second gunshot. The detective dropped.</p>
  
  <p>Mitch lowered Dean’s gun, a lock of hair swinging into his eyes. Dean thrashed against his restraints, trying to reach his knife. “God dammit!”</p>
  
  <p>“That’s not going to work on me, sweetheart,” the siren said to Bobbie, who was holding the dagger, staring down at Holden’s body in horror.</p>
  
  <p>“Mitch,” Bobbie said. “Mitch, help me.”</p>
  
  <p>Mitch didn’t look. He stared blankly ahead of himself.</p>
  
  <p>“Mitch, honey,” said the siren. “That’s the killer. She’s a siren, pretending to be me. Kill her.”</p>
  
  <p>“No, it’s me!” Bobbie said. “Mitch, don’t listen to her!”</p>
  
  <p>Slowly, Mitch looked up. He started slowly towards Bobbie, the gun still in his hand.</p>
  
  <p>“Mitch...”</p>
  
  <p>“Kill her,” the siren said.</p>
  
  <p>Bobbie wasn’t waiting for that to happen. She lunged at Mitch, knocking the gun out of his hand, and jammed the hilt of her dagger into his jaw, sending him to the floor.</p>
  
  <p>“Mitch!” she yelled, dropping to her knees beside him and grabbing the front of his shirt. “Mitch, it’s me. You need to snap out of it. She’s a siren. Listen, Mitch, can you hear me? It’s me, it’s Bobbie—”</p>
  
  <p>She was shaking him. His eyes slowly found hers.</p>
  
  <p>“...Mitch?”</p>
  
  <p>He seized her wrist, and before she could stop him, he’d wrested the dagger from her hands. “No!” Bobbie tried to grab it back. Behind her, she heard the siren say, “Do it! Kill her!”</p>
  
  <p>“Mitch, no, give me the dagger, don’t—”</p>
  
  <p>He yanked it over his head, out of her reach. She tried to tear herself out of his grip, but he held fast. Mitch raised the dagger in the air.</p>
  
  <p>“It’s me! Mitch, it’s me!”</p>
  
  <p>He brought the dagger down with a sickening noise into his own side.</p>
  
  <p>“<em>No!</em>” Bobbie screamed.</p>
  
  <p>Mitch panted and gasped—but his eyes focused again.</p>
  
  <p>“The blood of a victim, Bobbie!” Dean roared from the other side of the room.</p>
  
  <p>Bobbie gasped. Without hesitation, she grabbed the hilt of the dagger with both hands. She yanked it out of her friend’s side, twisted on the floor, and threw it, sending it cartwheeling through the air. With a final thump, it hit the siren in the chest.</p>
  
  <p>She fell to the floor, dead.</p>
  
  <p>Bobbie turned back to Mitch, grabbing at his shirt again. His hair fanned out on the carpet below him. She slapped his cheek, and his eyes fluttered open again.</p>
  
  <p>“Mitch! What do I—are you—” She held in a sob. “Tell me what to do!”</p>
  
  <p>He groaned. “Put pressure on it,” he said. “Make him call 911. I—” He stopped talking to take several breaths. “I’m going into shock. I think I hit my kidney.”</p>
  
  <p>She did as he said.</p>
  
  <p>Dean freed himself, finally, and made his way unsteadily to the detective. He checked his pulse. Holden was dead. Dean was panting from his mouth; the blood in his nose had finally clotted. He unclipped the dead man's radio and made the call.</p>
  
  <p class="divider">* * *</p>
  
  <p>“Wow,” Sam said into the phone. “That’s rough stuff.”</p>
  
  <p>Jack could hear Dean’s answer from the phone: “Yeah. It looks like Mitch is gonna be all right. They’re gonna discharge him tomorrow. I mean... today, I guess.”</p>
  
  <p>“How about you?” Sam said. “You get patched up?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah,” said Dean. “Not my first broken nose. Or my last, probably.”</p>
  
  <p>Sam huffed a laugh. They were sitting in the kitchen. It was late. Jack had dozed off on the couch in the afternoon, and woken up six hours later with a fuzzy mouth and a rumbling stomach. He’d wandered through the dark bunker, not expecting to find anyone in the kitchen at this hour, but Sam had been at the table with a stack of books and a pot of tea. Now Jack was sitting up on the counter, socked feet dangling, eating a bowl of cereal. Sitting on the counter was strictly forbidden by Dean, but Sam usually let him do it.</p>
  
  <p>“Well, I’ve been looking through the library for a way to kill an archangel,” said Sam. “Nothing yet.”</p>
  
  <p>“Anything about...”</p>
  
  <p>“No,” Sam said, cutting him off. “Nothing about that either.”</p>
  
  <p>Jack sensed Sam’s flurry of anxiety, but couldn’t tell where it originated.</p>
  
  <p>“Okay,” said Dean. “I gotta get going.”</p>
  
  <p>“All right. You gonna head home tomorrow after you get everything wrapped up?”</p>
  
  <p>Jack caught the last few little Frosted Flakes on his spoon. After a few more seconds of silence, he looked up.</p>
  
  <p>Sam was frowning down at his phone. “He hung up.”</p>
  
  <p>Then Sam shook his head, resetting.</p>
  
  <p>“So they caught the siren?” Jack said.</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah,” said Sam. “Sounds like it turned into a mess. It shifted into Bobbie.”</p>
  
  <p>“Instagram Bobbie?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah,” said Sam. “And tried to seduce Mitch.”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh,” said Jack. “But I thought they weren’t... ‘together.’”</p>
  
  <p>He said it slowly, hoping it would make more sense when said out loud than in his head. Sam had said they weren’t together, but from their pictures, they were together all the time, and the distinction Sam and Mary had made between “partners” and a “couple” was still unclear to him. Sam would probably explain it, if he asked, but sometimes Jack got tired of asking so many questions.</p>
  
  <p>“They’re not,” Sam said. “The monster was messing with Mitch’s head.”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh,” said Jack.</p>
  
  <p>Sam looked over at Jack, drumming his fingers quietly on his black phone screen.</p>
  
  <p>“How you doing, Jack?”</p>
  
  <p>“Okay,” said Jack.</p>
  
  <p>“Really?” Sam said.</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah,” said Jack. And it wasn’t a lie. “Physically.”</p>
  
  <p>“But... mentally?”</p>
  
  <p>“I’m worried,” Jack said. “About Michael.”</p>
  
  <p>Sam nodded, looking back at his phone.</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah,” he said. “You’re not the only one.” He sighed. “Have you seen Cas around?”</p>
  
  <p>Jack stiffened. “No,” he said.</p>
  
  <p>“Do you know where he is? I gotta talk to him about some stuff.”</p>
  
  <p>“No,” said Jack again.</p>
  
  <p>“When was the last time you saw him?” Sam asked.</p>
  
  <p>“I don’t know,” Jack said. “I’ve been asleep a lot.”</p>
  
  <p>Sam raised his eyebrows. “Fair.” He stood. “I’m gonna go look for him. You going back to bed?”</p>
  
  <p>Jack nodded. “Probably.”</p>
  
  <p>“Okay. Good night, Jack.”</p>
  
  <p>“Good night.”</p>

  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Mitch lies in a hospital bed, hooked up to IV and oxygen, asleep. His hair is clean and neat again, fanned out on the pillow. The BEEP, BEEP, BEEP of his heart rate is steady. Outside, BIRDS are singing--early morning.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean appears in the doorway, KNOCKING gently. He has a bandage over the bridge of his nose, and the blood is cleaned off, but it's deeply bruised.</p>

  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean looks upset. He tilts his head a little, trying to see her face. She stares resolutely out the window.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(finally)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">That's... not how Mitch sees you.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Yeah. Apparently.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She turns to look at Dean.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">So what am I supposed to do about that?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean has no answer to offer.</p>
  
  <p class="divider">*</p>
  
  <p>The hospital kept Mitch until the next day, and Dean took the excuse to stay in town another day. He didn’t have any kind of plan after that, and staved off the dread by telling himself something would crop up. If it didn’t, his contingency plan would be to call Mary and take her on vacation—they could drive out to the coast, or something, or a lake cabin. She would want some time off, and she wouldn’t ask questions.</p>
  
  <p>With that backup in his back pocket, Dean geared up to do what he did best: kill time. He went to the strip mall and wasted a couple hours between the sporting goods store and the Best Buy. He went back to the hospital and visited Mitch around dinner time, figuring the guy could use the company. But he was asleep. So Dean sat in the lounge and thumbed through some legal thriller, left on the end table, while half-watching an <em>X-Files</em> rerun on the old TV (it was “Monday”). He’d wait and see if Mitch woke up, and then he’d go eat some dinner. He didn’t want to go back to the motel, but he needed to, eventually, but he also needed not to go to a bar, and it was hard because there wasn’t much else to do, and he couldn’t avoid the motel forever.</p>
  
  <p>But he could get pretty close.</p>
  
  <p>A mother and her teenage daughter came into the lounge, ushered by a nurse. The mother had a stony look on her face; her daughter was crying silently. Dean hunched further over his book, turning away to face the window. He tried to make his back look very interested in the made-up legal case of the guy who’d killed his own twin.</p>
  
  <p>The nurse shuffled out, leaving the mother and daughter alone with Dean. For a minute, there was silence. Then Dean heard it—quiet, suppressed sobs, coming from someone trying their hardest to be silent. He turned a page loudly, blindly. A chapter heading looked up at him. The person sobbing choked, and suddenly got much louder. A chair creaked, and the legs squealed on the tile floor. He heard the sound of a tissue being pulled out of a box. The sobs got muffled, but more violent, the vocalization after each one getting higher and higher, mounting towards hysterical. Slowly, Dean closed the paperback. He raised his eyes to the dark window in front of him, and looked at the dim reflections on the glass. There he was, hunched in the foreground, 5 o’clock shadowed, his broken nose a dark bruise in the middle of his face. Behind him, the daughter sat with her legs folded up in front of herself, sobbing violently into her knees. Her whole body shook, her fingernails dug into the flesh of her calves. And he saw, to his surprise, her mother sitting next to her, still and silent, hands loose in her lap. Not touching or comforting her daughter at all. She just stared fixedly ahead. It looked like she was looking at her own eyes in the glass, but Dean couldn’t tell. She took no notice of him looking. She was alone in the world.</p>
  
  <p>The sight of the girl’s fingernails digging into her own legs made Dean’s stomach jump into his throat, and he stood quickly and left the room.</p>
  
  <p>Outside the hospital, the air was cold and clear. The lights in the parking lot were ugly white LEDs. Dean could see his breath, coming in rapid clouds in front of his face. He walked blindly out and around a corner, stopping near some shrubs, and put his hand on the wall. The bricks were cool and smooth, the lines of mortar rough in between. The sensation grounded him. He counted back from ten.</p>
  
  <p><em>Ten. </em>Everything’s fine.</p>
  
  <p><em>Nine. </em>Not your responsibility.</p>
  
  <p><em>Eight</em>. Everyone’s alive.</p>
  
  <p><em>Seven</em>. Except for her husband.</p>
  
  <p>His other hand moved, of its own accord, towards his pocket, but he stopped it.</p>
  
  <p><em>Six</em>. Don’t.</p>
  
  <p><em>Five</em>. He wasn’t going to throw his phone again. It was brand new. <em>Four. </em>Not going to kick another wall, either. Instead, he started scrubbing his thumb against the rough mortar between the bricks, like he was trying to scrape something off it.</p>
  
  <p><em>Three</em>. Everything’s fine.<em> Two</em>. Everything’s fine. <em>One</em>.</p>
  
  <p>Pain in his thumb brought him back to reality. He had scraped the top layer of skin off, and pinpricks of blood bloomed between the flakes of white dead skin. The mixture of pain, anger, and whatever else still roiled nauseously in his ribcage, but he didn’t want to smash a window anymore. He wiped his hand on his jacket and exhaled.</p>
  
  <p>“Okay,” he said to himself, and set off towards the car.</p>

  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. BAR. NIGHT.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Ambient rock music plays. Dean sits in the same Jonesboro hipster bar, alone at the bar, looking at his phone. He finishes his whiskey and signals the cute bartender. She comes over.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Could I get another one of these?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BARTENDER</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Sure thing.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She smiles, flirtatious. Dean gives her a crooked grin.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BARTENDER</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">What is this, your third time this week?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">What can I say, I'm a creature of habit.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BARTENDER</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I'm not complaining.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She gives him another smile before leaving to get the whiskey.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">He goes back to looking at his phone. He's looking at Instagram--Bobbie and Mitch's #vanlife account.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">He looks at their most recent picture: The van in a park at sunset. Below, the top comment says: <em>Beautiful! I wish I had your life! </em></p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">You have no idea.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean scrolls down and watches their most recent video (2 hours earlier). The camera points out the window of the van. The sun has just set at the end of the highway. The geotag says Oklahoma.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">MUSIC comes from the radio, mostly muffled by the wind. The person filming points the camera out the passenger window-- tall grass flies by. Cows. We catch a glimpse of Bobbie in the sideview mirror. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUr5_QVPCAI">“DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE”</a> by the Mamas and the Papas is the song playing, faintly.</p>

  <p class="screenplay screendir">He watches the camera turn the rest of the way to Mitch, in the driver's seat, his hair fluttering in the breeze.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BOBBIE (O.S.)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(on phone)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Say hey.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Mitch glances over. His face is somber.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">MITCH</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Hey.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean's smile fades.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">The bartender reappears, and REFILLS his whiskey glass.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BARTENDER</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Anything else I can get you? My number? Some ice for that?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">She gestures to her nose.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(appreciative)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Smooth.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BARTENDER</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">I try. What happened? Gonna tell me should I see the other guy?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Sorry to disappoint, but the other guy is a pole I walked into.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">BARTENDER</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(laughing)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Well, if you don’t want any ice...?</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay parenthetical">(diplomatic)</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Thanks. Just the bill.</p>

  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. IMPALA. NIGHT.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean drives, alone. Orange streetlights flicker by. <em>While I'm far away from you, my baby... </em></p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Dean's motel room door opens, and he walks in. He drops his duffel bag.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. BUNKER - KITCHEN. NIGHT.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Pan slowly around behind CASTIEL, sitting alone at the kitchen table. His hands are clasped in front of himself on the table.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">
    <em>I know it's hard for you, my baby... </em>
  </p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Jack appears in the doorway. Cas looks over at him; we still don't see his face.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">
    <em>Because it's hard for me, my baby... </em>

  <p class="screenplay screendir">Overhead shot: Dean lies in bed, lights off, eyes closed, hands clasped over his chest, face screwed up in discomfort.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Zoom in, closer to Dean's face, closer...</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">
    <em>And the darkest hour is just before the dawn...</em>

  <p class="screenplay screendir">The music SWELLS...</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">INT. NIGHTMARE.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Darkness. THUNDER CRASHES. A shadow splits the dark floor. An ornate mirror, cracked, leans against a dark wall. The CHORUS SINGS...</p>

    <em>Each night before you go to bed, my baby... </em>
  </p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">
    <em>Whisper a little prayer for me, my baby... </em>
  </p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">Lightning flashes, and we see--Dean's reflection in the mirror.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">His hands are covered in blood.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay screendir">His eyes flash silver.</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay character">MICHAEL!DEAN</p>
  
  <p class="screenplay dialogue">Welcome back, Dean.</p>

    <em>And tell all the stars above...</em>
