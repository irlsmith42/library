      <p class="screendir">EXT. SIMMZY’S BAIT AND TACKLE. DAY.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">It’s an overcast day on the quaint main street of a small town. It’s early — the street is deserted, and the lights in the bait &amp; tackle shop are off. CASTIEL walks across the street.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel tries the door, but it’s locked. He checks the sign, which says “OPEN 9AM - 6PM.” He checks his watch. It’s 9:05. He peers inside the darkened shop.</p>
      
      <p class="character">ANDY (O.S.)</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">I’m sure the sheriff’s doing everything he can. Yep.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel turns to see ANDY, the shop owner, a burly bearded man in flannels, approach. He’s talking on his phone, frowning.  </p>
      
      <p class="character">ANDY</p>
      
      <p class="parenthetical">(to phone)</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">I will. You let me know. Okay, Cam. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Andy hangs up. He takes out his keys and begins to unlock the door.</p>
      
      <p class="character">ANDY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Morning, Clarence. </p>

      <p class="dialogue">Come on in, early bird. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Andy opens the door and they enter the shop. </p>
      
      <p class="character">ANDY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">So, what can I do for you today? Bait working out good?</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Andy walks behind the counter while Castiel picks out some bait and supplies from the display racks. </p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">The bait? It’s working out fine. I think it’s the fish. They’ve begun to anticipate me.</p>
      
      <p class="character">ANDY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Yeah, the fish can be smart. I’d switch up spots. </p>

      <p class="dialogue">Maps are over there.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Andy indicates a rack of maps. Castiel walks over to it and flips through.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Fishing is supposed to be meditative, I’m told. I can’t say I find it very relaxing myself.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel looks up and sees that Andy is frowning down at his phone. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel takes a map and walks to the counter with his purchases. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Andy looks up, clearly preoccupied. </p>

      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">That’s it. Is everything all right with you, Andy? </p>
      
      <p class="character">ANDY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">There’s some trouble in the neighborhood. Teenager went missing, lives in the house behind us. Sheriff’s Department was down at the lake this morning. Rumor has it they found someone — we’re hoping it’s not Alex.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel looks troubled.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>

      <p class="screendir">INT. CABIN – KITCHEN. DAY. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel enters the small kitchen, his arms full of fishing gear — a box and two fishing rods. CLINK, he sets his car keys down on the counter. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">The sliding glass back door is ajar. Outside, woods and a porch railing are visible. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">A voice comes in from the back porch:</p>
      
      <p class="character">VOICE (O.S.)</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">How was it?</p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Good. I got everything we need. Andy said we should try a new spot.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel sets the gear down. He goes to the back door, slides it open, and sticks his head out.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">EXT. CABIN – PORCH. DAY.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">JACK is sitting cross-legged on the deck, examining a jar full of sticks and leaves. </p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">How’s your houseguest?</p>
      
      <p class="character">JACK</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">He’s good. I think it’s time to let him out. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack holds the jar up and looks inside. There’s a stickbug crawling slowly up the twig. </p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">I think that would be for the best.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack stands up and takes the jar to the railing. He carefully unscrews the lid and the bug crawls out onto the railing. He looks at it with interest. Castiel watches Jack fondly.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel’s phone BUZZES. He pulls it out of his pocket.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">CALL FROM DEAN.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel looks at the phone in his hand. </p>

      <p class="dialogue">Are we going back home to the bunker soon?</p>

      <p class="dialogue">Soon.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack turns around.</p>

      <p class="character">JACK</p>

      <p class="dialogue">Ready. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">EXT. LAKESIDE. DAY. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack and Castiel walk down the grassy slope. Jack carries the fishing gear, and Castiel is holding the unfolded map, reading it like a newspaper. He frowns at it.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">According to this, the dock should be at the end of this trail...</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack puts a hand on Cas’s arm, stopping him.</p>
      
      <p class="character">JACK</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Cas. Look.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel looks up. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">The dock is occupied by several uniformed Sheriff’s Department officers, and there’s a diver in the water. Crime tape divides the dock from the public. A few bystanders watch.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">They approach the bystanders. </p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">What’s going on?</p>
      
      <p class="character">TOWNSPERSON #1</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">They found a body. They think it might be Alex. It looks like he drowned. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack, holding the fishing gear, looks at Castiel. </p>
      
      <p class="character">JACK</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Cas, should we look into it?</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel looks hesitant.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">It was probably an accident. And... we’re on vacation.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">But helping people is what we do. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel looks at Jack very fondly. He smiles slightly.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Okay. We can try.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack smiles. Then he GLITCHES for a second. For a second, his image vanishes, then reappears as if nothing happened.   </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel doesn’t seem to notice.</p>

      <p class="screendir">A young man, ALEX GREGORY (19) is unconscious, tied up by his wrists to the ceiling. His face is bruised, and he has a needle in his neck, connected to a tube of glowing blue liquid. Next to him, a YOUNG WOMAN (20s) is tied in the same way. </p>

      <p class="dialogue">That’s right. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Behind Jack, Castiel is sitting with his hands folded in a chair against the wall. The woman sitting next to him, MELLY KROKOWSKI (40s), fiddles with her scarf anxiously. She checks her phone. Castiel notices her agitation. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack turns around, giving Castiel an open-handed shrug. Castiel tilts his head and raises his eyebrows. </p>

      <p class="screendir">She glances at Jack, who is looking up at the bulletin board.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">By the bulletin board, Jack gazes up at the flyers. Among flyers for local events, there are a lot of missing persons flyers. Jack spots one for ALEX GREGORY, the missing teen. He pulls it down and examines it. We recognize his face from the cave earlier. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack sees something out the corner of his eye. He looks up. </p>

      <p class="screendir">He lunges forward, and before Sheriff Roy can block him, grabs him by the shoulder and puts his palm on his forehead to smite him. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel’s hand lights up — then it FLASHES once, twice, and the light DIMS. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Not enough juice.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel’s eyes widen in horror. THUNK, the djinn catches him in the jaw with his fist, and Castiel is knocked back onto the floor of the cave.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Sheriff Roy turns on Melly and her son. </p>
      
      <p class="character">SHERIFF ROY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Close your eyes, Melly. This won’t hurt a bit. </p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">You stay away from us!</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">She clutches Caleb to her chest. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Sheriff Roy leans down, his eyes lighting up blue, a SPARK on his fingertips. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Melly and Caleb cover their eyes—</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">THUNK — the sheriff CRIES OUT as an angel blade appears out the front of his throat. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">He SLUMPS to the side, dead. Castiel, bruised, blade in hand, stands above them. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Melly and Caleb open their eyes and look up at him in shock.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel closes his eyes, breathing heavily. </p>

        <u>ACT FIVE</u>
      </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">EXT. LAKESIDE. DAY. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">It’s sunset. Two ambulances are parked by the edge of the woods. Alex, still alive, is being loaded into one on a stretcher. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Caleb, wrapped in a blanket, sits on the back of the other. An EMT is tending to his broken ankle. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel and Melly stand off to the side with another EMT. Melly also has a blanket around her shoulders. The EMT is putting a blanket around Castiel’s shoulders. </p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Um. Thank you. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">The EMT nods and leaves.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel lifts the hems of the blanket in his hands, looking at it — then leaves it on. Melly is talking to him:</p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">You and I talked at the sheriff’s office this morning, and you said you’d help me. Then a few hours later, you called me, saying you had found Caleb’s campsite... but he wasn’t there.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">They both look over at Caleb. </p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">You were telling me where it was, by the old silver mine, and then I heard you get jumped. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel nods, frowning.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">I’m starting to remember now. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Melly nods. </p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">I called the sheriff’s department. But I knew they — well, I knew they weren’t going to take me seriously, so I came down myself. And I found Caleb. His ankle was broken, but he told me that he saw you getting dragged away... So we went looking for you.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel nods. </p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">And we found you in the cave. With... with him. </p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">I’m grateful you did.</p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue"><u>You’re</u> grateful? You saved us!</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel shakes his head.  </p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">I... Who knows how long I would have stayed down there. You and Caleb saved me.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">He looks away from her. The weight of his words mostly goes over her head, but she frowns sadly, and adjusts the blanket over his shoulders in a mom-like way.  </p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">She pats his shoulder. </p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">But what... what was he? </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel sighs and looks back at her.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Melly, there are things in this world that... aren’t human. The sheriff, he was... one of them. He wasn’t human. He was only pretending. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Melly doesn’t understand. She opens her mouth to ask more questions, but before she can—</p>
      
      <p class="character">CALEB</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Mom? </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">They look over at Caleb, sitting in the ambulance. An EMT stands next to him. Castiel and Melly walk over.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CALEB</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Do you know where Dad is?</p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">He’s coming, sweetheart. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Melly slides off her blanket and puts it around his shoulders.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CALEB</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Mom, I already have one.</p>
      
      <p class="character">EMT</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">We’re going to take him to the hospital. He needs a cast. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">The EMT walks off. Castiel watches her go. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">He turns back to Caleb.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Mind if I take a look?</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Caleb pulls back his blankets to reveal his bloody ankle. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel lifts his hand and holds it over Caleb’s leg. His hand begins to glow. Caleb and Melly both watch in wonder. Then the light FLICKERS again. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel grits his teeth, rallying his strength. The light steadies, and with a quiet CRUNCH, Caleb’s bone knits back together and his skin heals over. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Caleb and Melly both GASP. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel drops his hand, a little dizzy from the effort. He blinks. Melly looks up at him.</p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">How — but you — </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Caleb runs his hand up and down his smooth shin.</p>
      
      <p class="character">CALEB</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Holy crap! It’s a miracle! </p>
      
      <p class="character">MALE VOICE</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Hey. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">All turn. MELLY’S HUSBAND is there. </p>
      
      <p class="character">CALEB</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Dad!</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Caleb’s dad gathers him up in a hug. Then Melly hugs them both, wrapping her arms around her husband’s shoulders.</p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY’S HUSBAND</p>
      
      <p class="parenthetical">(muffled)</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">I’m so glad you guys are okay…</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Melly wipes tears from her eyes. </p>
      
      <p class="character">MELLY</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Yeah...</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Over her husband’s shoulder, she makes eye contact with Castiel. She smiles at him through tears. Castiel smiles back and gives a small nod. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">He turns and walks away towards the lake with his hands in his pockets. The sun is setting over the water, turning it gold. Cas looks out at the view, squinting against the light. Then he turns back to look at the family again. Melly has her arm around her husband, who is ruffling Caleb’s hair. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Castiel turns back towards the water. He walks to a driftwood log on the shore, and sits down on it. He folds his hands and bows his head.
      </p>
      
      <p class="character">CASTIEL</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Jack. I don’t think you can hear me, wherever you are. I just want to say that I’m sorry. I didn’t protect you. All I wanted was for you to be happy, and safe. That was my job. And I let you down. And I’ll never...</p>
      
      <p class="parenthetical">(He breaks off. Resets with a ragged breath)</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">And I’ll tell you that when we see each other again.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Cas sits for another moment, facing the shining lake. Then he stands, and begins walking along the beach, pulling out his phone.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">He opens his call log. He has several missed calls from Sam, and two voicemails. He scrolls. Nothing else.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Tight on Castiel looking at his phone, disappointed. He sighs and closes his eyes for a moment, dropping his arm to his side. Then he opens his eyes, and lifts his phone to his ear to listen to his messages.</p>
      
      <p class="character">SAM (O.S.)</p>
      
      <p class="parenthetical">(recorded message, on phone)</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Hey Cas. It’s Sam. I don’t know where you are right now, but Chuck is back — give us a call. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">BEEP.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Next message begins. Castiel turns his back on the ambulance, looking out over the lake. Wide shot as he listens to the next message:</p>
      
      <p class="character">SAM (O.S.)</p>
      
      <p class="parenthetical">(recorded message, on phone)</p>
      
      <p class="dialogue">Hey Cas. Sam again...</p>
