      <p class="screendir">The Impala drives down the sunny interstate, weaving between the stopped cars. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">EXT. GAS STATION. DAY.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">The Impala stops at a gas station. An auto repair shop is attached to a convenience store, with gas pumps out front. One abandoned car is still hooked up to a gas pump. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">The Impala pulls up next to the pump. The car doors open. </p>

      <p class="screendir">INT. BODY SHOP. DAY</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">A high SHRIEKING sound is coming from inside. Dean rounds a corner warily, reaching for his gun, before he sees the source of the noise--the angle grinder is still on, shrieking against a piece of metal and sending up sparks. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Dean approaches cautiously and turns it off. The shriek cuts off and echoes to relative silence. </p>

      <p class="screendir">EXT. GAS STATION. DAY.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">There’s a birdhouse in the shrubs outside the gas station. Jack stares at it, frowning deeply. He closes his eyes.</p>

      <p class="screendir">Jack sighs, eyes still closed, looking crushed. With an almost-crying twitch of the mouth, he goes into the store. As he walks past it, the shrub he was staring at withers and dies.</p>

      <p class="screendir">EXT. GAS STATION. DAY.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack opens the back door of the Impala and slides in. Sam sits in the passenger seat. Dean lowers the dog into the back seat and pets her again.</p>

      <p class="screendir">Dean straightens up and SHUTS the door. As the door slams shut, the dog fades and DISAPPEARS. Chuck-snapped.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Dean rapidly cycles through the stages of grief and stops at “anger.” As he looks up over the roof of the Impala, he sees--Chuck, standing on the median strip. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Chuck waves “hello” and grins, then vanishes.</p>

      <p class="screendir">INT. IMPALA. DAY.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack and Sam watch in silence as Dean, cursing and yelling, punches the paper towel dispenser, kicks the trash can next to the gas pump, and generally freaks out. Sam closes his eyes.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Jack, sitting in the back seat, leans forward, eyes still on Dean.</p>

      <p class="dialogue">Nothing. The Empty let him live too. Temporarily. But it said that... when he experienced a moment of true happiness, that’s when it would come to claim him.</p>

      <p class="character">SAM</p>

      <p class="dialogue">He didn’t want you to worry.</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Sam sighs and turns away, looking back out the front windshield at Dean. Dean is leaning against the wall, his back to the Impala, one arm against the wall and the other covering his face. </p>

      <p class="screendir">Through the window, we see Jack lean on the dashboard and rest his head in his arms. Outside the car, green plants growing on the edge of the driveway shrivel and turn brown. </p>

      <p class="screendir">Tight on Jack’s belt loop, where he’s clipped a ring of car keys--Castiel’s. He’s standing at the top of a library ladder, handing books down to Sam, who is holding a comically tall stack. (SONG fades down but does not end.)</p>

          <p class="screendir">Jack is panting, trying to raise the sword up. Lucifer finally turns to look at Sam. Whoa--he’s unexpectedly close. He's standing right behind Lucifer, within striking distance. Holding off Jack has distracted him.</p>

          <p class="screendir">The blade in Jack’s hand flickers again and then vanishes and reappears in Sam’s hand. Lucifer turns back to Sam just in time to see it PLUNGE INTO HIS CHEST. </p>
          
          <p class="screendir">He looks down in shock. The wound is glowing bright white, getting brighter, brighter. Then he looks up at Sam, who is still gripping the handle, his teeth bared. </p>
