  <u>TEASER</u>
</p>

<p class="screendir">EXT. EMPTY. NIGHT. </p>

<p class="screendir">The final “Don’t you cry no more...” echoes to silence as we pick up where the previous episode left off. 3/4 of Team Free Will 2.0 stare down the Empty in the form of their missing fourth. </p>

<p class="screendir">Dean, still covered in blood and dirt, glares at Empty!Castiel with a mix of hatred and horror. Sam, still slightly bloody from the fight with Lucifer, holds Dean by the arm. Jack stares brokenly at Empty!Castiel, his mouth open sadly. </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty keeps its distance. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(clapping hands together) </p>

<p class="dialogue">Well, well, well. Mortals! What are you three doing out here, disrupting the... cosmic order? </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">What the hell are you? Where's Cass--what the hell did you do to him? </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">We had a deal, I kept it. He’s dead. Just like I promised. </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(snaps its fingers, remembering something.) </p>

<p class="dialogue">Ah! </p>

<p class="screendir">Waving a demonstrative hand, it begins walking towards them as it says:</p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL </p>

<p class="dialogue">But I’m being a terrible host! You don’t know how things work here, in the Empty--you human mortals, with your souls. Why would you? Of course! </p>

<p class="screendir">It gives them another unnatural smile, this one almost pained. </p>

<p class="screendir">SCREECH! Something makes a HORRIBLE SOUND--instantly cut off by the Empty waving its hand. </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty takes a deep breath, collecting itself. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">Tell me. When you humans die, what happens to your souls? </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">We go to Heaven and relive our happiest memories. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(snaps fingers) </p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes. Precisely. Well, out here in the Empty, things work a little differently... See, God steals all the best memories for Heaven. Angels, demons, reapers, when they die, they come here. And if they have no regrets when they come to the Empty, well, they’ve got no problem. Peaceful sleep, forevermore. But... if they do have regrets, well... </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty shrugs exaggeratedly. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s what they relive here in the Empty. Over and over and over... For ever and ever and ever. Long after God is dead and gone, and Heaven crumbles, and Hell freezes over, long after your universe shrivels up and dies... they’ll still be dreaming. </p>

<p class="screendir">Cut to wide shot. They’re tiny in the endless darkness. The Empty gestures back behind itself, into the expanse.</p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">And he’s one of them now. </p>

<p class="character">JACK</p>

<p class="dialogue">Castiel? </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty turns on Jack with a smile of undisguised loathing. For a second we hear another SCREECH--and the ground below their feet undulates, as if there is something under the surface, thrashing, trying to break free--</p>

<p class="screendir">Then the Empty raises its hand again, and everything stops. The men regain their balance. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes. He is. </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty looks at Dean. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">You know that this, all this, is your fault, don’t you...? </p>

<p class="screendir">Tight on Dean, shocked. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">...Nephilim? Your fault. </p>

<p class="screendir">As the Empty addresses Jack, its eyes slide to him. </p>

<p class="character">JACK</p>

<p class="dialogue">I know. I know it’s my fault. I’m sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. Death told me... </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(condescending, on the verge of laughing) </p>

<p class="dialogue">No... no, no, no. I don’t think you understand just how badly you messed things up out here. </p>

<p class="character">JACK</p>

<p class="dialogue">What? </p>

<p class="screendir">Empty!Castiel SNAPS its fingers. </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty EXPLODES. </p>

<p class="screendir">A cacophony of SCREECHING, WAILING, SHRIEKING--they are surrounded on all sides by bodies, as far as the eye can see, all of them writhing and thrashing, SCREAMING at the NOISE, THE NOISE, THE NOISE--Sam, Dean, and Jack all clap their hands over their ears, trying to block it out--</p>

  <u>ACT ONE</u>
</p>

<p class="screendir">EXT. THE EMPTY. NIGHT. </p>

<p class="screendir">THE NOISY EMPTY--Beings SCREAM. </p>

<p class="screendir">Everyone in the Empty is on their feet now. An overwhelming throng, all the way to the horizon, all too consumed with their own agony to notice anyone else. </p>

<p class="screendir">At the center of the mob stand Sam, Dean, Jack, and Empty!Castiel. Sam and Dean cover their ears, hunched over, faces screwed up. Jack looks around in horror. The Empty has its arms folded and is glaring at Jack. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">You did this! You woke them up. All of them. </p>

<p class="character">JACK</p>

<p class="dialogue">Everyone? </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(threatening hiss) </p>

<p class="dialogue">All the ones with <u>regrets</u>. </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty SNAPS its fingers and the screeching fades down to a more bearable listening level. Sam and Dean take their hands down and look around, dazed. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(to the Empty) </p>

<p class="dialogue">Look. We came here for a reason. And it wasn’t to bother you. We just needed someplace to make a plan--where Chuck couldn’t hear us.</p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(incredulous, as if talking to audience) </p>

<p class="dialogue">Don’t want to 'bother me'--he doesn’t want to bother me. </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(to Sam, fake polite) </p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh, well by all means. Come right in. </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(snapping back to aggressive) </p>

<p class="dialogue">You’re not supposed to be here. You’re mortals. Where is the respect for the cosmic order? </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">We don’t need your help. We just need somewhere quiet. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(breathless fake surprise) </p>

<p class="dialogue">You want quiet? Wow--so do I! We should--gosh, I don’t know,it sounds like we want the same thing, maybe we could--work together? And I’ve got plenty of folks here who would love to help you out too. </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty SNAPS its fingers viciously. Out of the crowd steps a familiar figure--Dean, dressed in black with a familiar cap. APOCALYPSE MICHAEL. </p>

<p class="screendir">Sam pulls Dean back, and Jack steps forward protectively. </p>

<p class="character">MICHAEL!DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey there. You fellas miss me? </p>

<p class="screendir">Michael!Dean feints towards real Dean as if to take a shot, but then he dissolves, laughing, back into the black surface. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">No? Maybe another old friend? </p>

<p class="screendir">The crowd parts and someone emerges--ALISTAIR. Tight on Dean’s reaction. </p>

<p class="screendir">Alistair smiles at him. </p>

<p class="character">ALISTAIR </p>

<p class="dialogue">Dean, Dean, Dean. Long time no see. You haven’t changed a bit. </p>

<p class="screendir">Dean’s jaw clenches and unclenches.</p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(low) </p>

<p class="dialogue">You stay away from me. </p>

<p class="screendir">Empty!Castiel pantomimes answering a phone. Dean looks at it. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh. Someone else on the line for you... </p>

<p class="screendir">Dean turns back to where Alistair was. He’s gone. In his place--</p>

<p class="character">MEG </p>

<p class="dialogue">Hi there, boys. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">Meg. </p>

<p class="character">MEG </p>

<p class="dialogue">Good to see you. I’m so glad I let Crowley kill me just to buy a little time for you two and Cass to escape. And now, after all that, he’s down here too. </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">All demons come here when they die. </p>

<p class="screendir">(Behind Dean, Sam looks around, as if nervous Crowley is going to pop up behind them.) </p>

<p class="character">MEG </p>

<p class="dialogue">I was talking about Cass. </p>

<p class="screendir">Dean’s face hardens. Meg steps closer. </p>

<p class="character">MEG </p>

<p class="dialogue">You let me die for you. You let Crowley die for you. And then, last but not least, you let Cass die for you. Was it worth it, Dean? </p>

<p class="screendir">Dean leans away from her, lip twitching, saying nothing. </p>

<p class="character">MEG </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(voice low) </p>

<p class="dialogue">I bet that keeps you up at night, doesn’t it? </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(when he doesn’t answer) </p>

<p class="dialogue">Good.</p>

<p class="screendir">Meg dissolves and vanishes. </p>

<p class="screendir">Dean, silent, looks stricken. Sam rounds on Empty!Castiel. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">I think that’s enough. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">Really? I think you have someone who wants to talk, actually. </p>

<p class="screendir">Sam turns to see--RUBY. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">Ruby. </p>

<p class="screendir">He stares at her. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">Ruby, I-- </p>

<p class="character">RUBY </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(interrupting) </p>

<p class="dialogue">Did Castiel send you guys? </p>

<p class="screendir">Not the question Sam was expecting. He’s thrown. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">Uh... Cass? </p>

<p class="character">RUBY </p>

<p class="dialogue">What do you mean, “Uh, Cass?”? Castiel and I have a deal. I gave him the Occultum. In exchange, he’s going to get me out of here. </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty smiles, shaking its head. Silly kids. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">Sorry, Ruby, but Cass is dead. And that’s not why we’re here. </p>

<p class="character">RUBY </p>

<p class="dialogue">But we--we had a deal. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry. </p>

<p class="character">RUBY </p>

<p class="dialogue">No. You have to take me with you when you go. You have to. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">We can’t. That’s not what we’re here for... </p>

<p class="character">RUBY </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(with rising hysteria) </p>

<p class="dialogue">You son of a bitch. You backstabbing sons of bitches. We had a deal--we had a deal! Take me with you, you have to, you have to! </p>

<p class="screendir">Her voice has risen to a SCREAM. She lunges at Sam--as soon as her fists make contact with his chest, she dissolves. </p>

<p class="screendir">Sam breathes heavily, staring at where Ruby was. The Empty turns to Jack. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">I bet you’d like to talk to Castiel, right? </p>

<p class="character">JACK</p>

<p class="dialogue">Can I? </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">No. </p>

<p class="screendir">Jack looks crestfallen. Sam puts his hand on Jack’s shoulder and steps towards the Empty. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">All right, that’s enough! </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty shrugs. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">Fine, fine. Whatever you want. Quiet place to talk? Fine. Here you go. </p>

<p class="screendir">In an instant, everyone around them vanishes and silence falls again. No snap--we simply cut to a wide, empty shot. Just them in the middle of the void. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay. Thank you. </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(to Dean and Jack) </p>

<p class="dialogue">We need to make a plan to take down Chuck. This is the only place we can do it without him overhearing and outmaneuvering us.</p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah. I got that. So lay it on me. What did you guys come up with? </p>

<p class="screendir">Jack and Sam look at each other. </p>

<p class="character">JACK</p>

<p class="dialogue">Well, nothing. </p>

<p class="screendir">Dean looks incredulous. </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">Fantastic. Two months of research, and “Go to the Empty”--that’s your big plan. </p>

<p class="screendir">Empty!Castiel laughs to itself. Dean rounds on it. </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">And you, you think this is funny? </p>

<p class="character">JACK</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(to Empty!Castiel) </p>

<p class="dialogue">You could help us. You were helping Billie. </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah. 'Cause that worked out great. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(nodding) </p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s true, that’s true. I was helping Death. And I do hate God. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">So help us. We can work together. </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(interrupting) </p>

<p class="dialogue">And what happens to you if there’s no Chuck? </p>

<p class="screendir">Another exaggerated shrug from the Empty. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">It would certainly rearrange the cosmic order. No way to know how. Though I could speculate. </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(hostile) </p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay. All right. So speculate. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">Dean. </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(to Sam, with attitude) </p>

<p class="dialogue">You’re seriously asking me to just trust this thing? Before we make another deal with another devil, I’d like to know what we’re getting into. That alright with you? </p>

<p class="screendir">Sam holds up his hands in surrender. Head cocked, The Empty regards Dean with the bemusement of a kid looking at an unusual insect. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">Fascinating. You think I would double cross you? </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">Why wouldn’t you? </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(simply) </p>

<p class="dialogue">Because you don’t matter to me. </p>

<p class="screendir">Oof. Dean blinks. Then he exchanges a look with Sam. </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">Fair enough. So tell us. What happens to the cosmic order without God? </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">God is the reason souls go to Heaven. Without him, they won’t. No more ascending. No more descending, either. No more sorting at all. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">Will they come here instead? </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty shrugs again. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">Probably. That's the way it would have been, if God had never invented Heaven and Hell to entertain himself.</p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">And you would be controlling all this? </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">No. I would be asleep. </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(with another glare at Jack) </p>

<p class="dialogue">I <u>should</u> be asleep. </p>

<p class="screendir">Jack folds his arms. So does the Empty. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL </p>

<p class="parenthetical">(after a pause) </p>

<p class="dialogue">So no big ideas to take down God, huh? 'Cause I have an idea. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">Do you? </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty is still making overly intense eye contact with Jack, who frowns back at it with narrowed eyes. Sam looks uneasily between them. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">You’re not going to like it. </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">Tell us. </p>

<p class="screendir">The Empty finally looks at him. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">Right now, your little Nephilim here is powered up from that bomb. The one you detonated out here. He’s like a power sponge. He sucks up life energy wherever he goes. </p>

<p class="screendir">BEGIN FLASHBACK SEQUENCE: </p>

<p class="screendir">15x18 – Plants around Jack die. </p>

<p class="screendir">15x19 – Shrub outside gas station shrivels and dies. </p>

<p class="screendir">15x19 - Jack powers up to fight Lucifer, and trees outside shrivel and die. </p>

<p class="screendir">15x19 - The power of Lucifer’s death flows into Jack. </p>

<p class="character">JACK</p>

<p class="dialogue">When Lucifer died... </p>

<p class="character">SAM</p>

<p class="dialogue">...That’s how he was able to open the portal. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">He could, right now, suck the power out of God and the Darkness and drain them both. </p>

<p class="character">DEAN</p>

<p class="dialogue">Well that’s just fantastic. What’s the catch? </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">Well, opening that portal cost him a lot. He’s going to need a boost. </p>

<p class="character">JACK</p>

<p class="dialogue">What kind of boost? </p>

<p class="screendir">Empty looks faux thoughtful, drumming its fingers against its chin. </p>

<p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh, nothing much. Just one human soul should do the trick. </p>

<p class="screendir">The men stare dramatically at each other. SKREE! </p>

    <p class="character">DEAN</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue">We’ll make Chuck think we’re doing the Cain and Abel thing, like what he wrote. We’ll lure him someplace and bring the Equalizer. Then, before we can use it, Jack will fly in, eat my soul, and use that power to blast Chuck and drain him. </p>

    <p class="dialogue">If you go through with this, you won’t go to Heaven, you know. </p>
    
    <p class="screendir">Dean looks at the Empty. </p>
    
    <p class="character">EMPTY!CASTIEL</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue">If he absorbs your soul. You’ll just cease to exist, you won’t die. No Heaven. </p>
    
    <p class="screendir">Dean looks at the Empty for another beat, then: </p>
    
    <p class="character">DEAN</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue">That was never in the cards for me. </p>
    
    <p class="screendir">Sam turns away, putting his hand on his mouth in distress. Dean looks at him. </p>
    
    <p class="character">DEAN</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue">Sam. This is what we have to do. It’s the whole world, or it’s me. Ain’t no choice. </p>
    
    <p class="screendir">Sam turns back around, eyes full of tears. </p>

    <p class="dialogue">What about me? </p>
    
    <p class="character">DEAN</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue">It’s not gonna be you, Sam. </p>
    
    <p class="screendir">Sam turns and walks away, leaving Jack and Dean with the Empty. Empty!Castiel seems uninterested in the boy melodrama. </p>

    <p class="dialogue">Great. If we’re all agreed. Nephilim here can stay with me until it’s time.</p>

Dean's eyes are squeezed tightly shut against the wind and the heat as they fly through--his teeth gritted, hair blasted back, as he holds the unconscious, shrouded Cas. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">The flames burn the shroud away, revealing Cas's face--still peacefully asleep, his hair flying in the wind--and then his body, in dark silhouette. </p>

      <p class="screendir">Pull back slightly. Cas is lying on his back a few feet away from Dean, eyes still closed. He's wearing a charcoal gray trench coat, the same cut as the one that he wore when we first met him, and his blue tie has been replaced with a darker indigo.

      <p class="screendir">We rise overhead, pulling back slowly. The ENGINE STOPS and we hear car doors OPEN. Dean and Cas lie unconscious at an angle, in the center of a burnt crater in the woods. We rise higher--we see that trees have fallen, radiating outward, Lazarus Rising-style. We see the Impala, parked at the edge of the trees, on yellow grass overgrown with blackberry bushes. Sam and Jack, tiny now as we rise up overhead, SLAM the car doors shut and hurry towards the middle of the crater. </p>

      <p class="screendir">The front door OPENS. Sam and Eileen enter. Sam has some blood on his shirt. Eileen has some blood on her jacket. </p>
            
      <p class="character">DEAN</p>
      <p class="parenthetical">(happy) </p>
      <p class="dialogue">Hey hey!</p>
      
      <p class="screendir">We rise overhead, slowly moving away. The music rises too, muffling their dialogue. Eileen and Sam sit down at the bar. Dean tries to ruffle Sam's hair and Sam swats his arm away. Cas slides them two beers. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Pulling back, we can see Jody and Donna's table, and Jack hard at work on his homework. Sam drinks, and Eileen raises her beer towards Dean, who leans his elbow on the bar, ready to listen to the play-by-play. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">EXT. DEAN &amp; CAS'S BAR. NIGHT. </p>
      
      <p class="screendir">Outside, the bar and the cars in the gravel parking lot are bathed in blue moonlight. Parked front and center, the Impala gleams. The song fades to an end. </p>
      
      <p class="transition"> FADE TO BLACK.</p>
      
      <p class="sectionhead">THE END. </p>
